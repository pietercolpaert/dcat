    <h1>A file host publishing LDES feeds for DCAT-AP exports from data portals across the World</h1>
    <p>These feeds implement the <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/LDES-DCAT-AP-feeds/">DCAT-AP Feeds</a> specification built on top of the <a href="https://w3id.org/ldes/specification">SEMIC LDES specification</a>. You can use an LDES client or an LDES to Service integration to fully replicate the dataset to your own system.</p>

      <li><a href="https://www.pieter.pm/dcat/flanders/feed.ttl">Flanders</a> - currently out of order due to file size constraints of Github. The files are still updated, but they are gzipped afterwards and therefore the current feed gives 404 when dereferencing the relations.</li>
